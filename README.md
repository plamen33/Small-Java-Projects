This repository contains small Java projects, which I am developing
during my Java learning.

1/ Calculator - this is a small Calculator application developed on Swing.
No plans for further upgrade, as SWING is almost obsolete.

2/ Digital Clock - a small Java Digital clock using the old Swing GUI.

3/ CalculatorJavaFX - Simple Calculator using the modern JavaFX platform based on the MVC design pattern.
